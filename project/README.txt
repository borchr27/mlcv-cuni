****NPGR035 Project****

This project contains of two separate parts and you must finish BOTH to get the credit. One of them is subtitled
"classification" and the other "page_reader". The main reason for, effectively, two projects is to examine
a broader spectrum of your machine learning in computer vision knowledge.
- "classification" part focuses on feature processing, model evaluation and model comparison.
- "page_reader" part focuses on application of classification in a vision related (toy) problem.

Both parts have their descriptions in a PDF together with template source files where necessary.
