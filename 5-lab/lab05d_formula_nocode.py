
# This task does not involve coding.
# - It would be best if you finished it on paper, since it will be more comfortable.
#   (unless you have a graphics tablet I suppose :) )

# Consider a given classifier and a given threshold:
# - The probability of classifying an object from class 0 to class 1 is 'alpha'.
# - The probability of classifying an object from class 1 to class 0 is 'beta'.
# - The number of positive objects in the sample is P.
# - The number of negative objects in the sample is N.

# Now, try to answer the following:
# 1) Express the values TP, FP, TN, FN in terms of 'alpha' and 'beta'.
# 2) What are the precision and recall values when we use this classifier on a balanced
#    dataset, meaning that N == P.
# 3) What are the precision and recall values when we use this classifier on an imbalanced
#    dataset, where N == 10 * P.
# 4) Draw a possible PR curve for this classifier.
# 5) Do the same for the ROC curve [fpr, tpr].
